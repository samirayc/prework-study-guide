# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was made to help bootcamp students like me organize new information into an easy-to-read study guide. My motivation was to make a tool that not only helps myself, but other students that may take the course and need simplified notes. I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript and the role they each play in developing a webpage.

## Usage

This study guide can be used to review the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. It contains related vocabulary and their definitions, as well as how these concepts and terms are actually used in web development. As well as that, if you open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It lists the topics learned in the pre-work and a summary of each.
