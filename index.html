        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user. It is an example of a semantic HTML element, meaning the name of the element describes its conent and role on the wbepage.</li>
          <li>The header element is represented by h1, h2, h3, etc. Headings are titles and subtitles that help organize a page.</li>
          <li>Img is an example of an element contained in the header. Elements like img have attributes, attributes being additional information about an element. For example, some attributes of img define the source of the image file, or describing the apprearance or function of an image.</li>
          <li>Any element inside of another element is called a child element. The element that holds all of the "children" is the parent element.</li>
          <li>The section element is a semantic element that defines a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicate how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>The three ways to style a webpage using CSS are: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is used when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file. This is useful for quick and permanent changes.</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page.</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. It keeps all CSS rules in a separate file, making design changes easier.</li>
          <li>A selector deines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
          <li>The class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, letting us choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule. Example: the class selector, card</li>
